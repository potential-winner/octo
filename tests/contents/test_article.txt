George Raymond Martin (he adopted the confirmation name Richard at 13 years old)[2] was born on September 20, 1948,[15] in Bayonne, New Jersey,[16] the son of longshoreman Raymond Collins Martin and Margaret Brady Martin. His mother's family had once been wealthy, owning a successful construction business, but lost it all in the Great Depression, something Martin was reminded about every day when he passed what used to be his family's dock and house.[17] He has two younger sisters, Darleen and Janet. He is predominantly of Irish descent;[18] a DNA test on the series Finding Your Roots showed him to be 53.6% "British and Irish", 22.4% Ashkenazi Jewish, and 15.6% "Broadly Northwestern European".[19][20]

The family first lived in a house on Broadway belonging to Martin's great-grandmother. In 1953, they moved to a federal housing project near the Bayonne docks.[21] During Martin's childhood, his world consisted predominantly of "First Street to Fifth Street", between his grade school and his home; this limited world made him want to travel and experience other places, but the only way of doing so was through his imagination, and he became a voracious reader.[22] Martin began writing and selling monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children, dramatic readings included. He also wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".[23] Martin had a habit of starting "endless stories" that he never completed, as they did not turn out as well on paper as he had imagined them.[24]

Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and later Marist High School. While there he became an avid comic-book fan, developing a strong interest in the superheroes being published by Marvel Comics,[25] and later credited Stan Lee for being one of his greatest literary influences; "Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien."[26] A letter Martin wrote to the editor of Fantastic Four was printed in issue #20 (November 1963); it was the first of many sent, e.g., Fantastic Four #32, #34, and others. Fans who read his letters wrote him letters in turn, and through such contacts, Martin joined the fledgling comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines;[27] he bought the first ticket to the world's first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964.[28][29] In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his prose superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier".[30]

In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill.[31] Eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War, to which he objected, Martin applied for and obtained conscientious objector status;[32] he instead did alternative service work for two years (1972â€“1974) as a VISTA volunteer, attached to the Cook County Legal Assistance Foundation.[31]
